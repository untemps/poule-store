	"description": "<p>The Orpington is a breed of chicken named after the town of Orpington, Kent, in south-east England.[3]:115 It was bred for superior egg laying while retaining meat quality.[3]:115 Its large size and soft appearance together with its rich colour and gentle contours give it an attractive appearance, and as such it is grown more often as a show bird rather than a utility breed. Hens often become broody and are good mothers. Although rather heavy, Orpingtons are able to fly small distances but rarely do so.</p><p>The original Black Orpington was bred by William Cook in 1886 by crossing Minorcas, Langshans and Plymouth Rocks to create a new hybrid bird. Cook selected a black bird that would exhibit well by hiding the dirt and soot of London.[4]:158 When the breed was shown in Madison Square Gardens in 1895, its popularity soared.[3]:115 Cook also bred the Orpington Duck.</p>",
